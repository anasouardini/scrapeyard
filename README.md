## ScrapeYard

Is a scraping library built on top of Playwright, it adds scraping-related features on top of the testing features that already exist in Playwright. It offers features such as:

- You can create new scraping projects with one command.
- Inject `Reactjs` component into the target page.
- Facilitates the communication between your injected code and your scraping server.
- Abstracts methods like `onLoad`, `clearDOM` and `uploadFile` so you don't have to create them yourself.
